13 Oct 20:11

Problem: 
Enforcing IT Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and their consumers is challenging using current industry practices and technology. IT Financial Management is currently focused, or rather limited to retroactive cost analysis, shadow charging and accounting for Providers' periodical billing.

Solution Abstract: 
Use Smart Contracts to implement Service Level Agreements between MSPs and their consumers. Each Service Request from the Consumer to the MSP is recorded by the Contract, governed by the terms and conditions of the Service Agreement, in addition to the specific SLA targets based on the Request. 

The Contract can be used to govern and settle transactions between the two parties based on real time State updates of the request, where the Consumer can only pay the provider for Service Requests fulfilled within the SLA targets, or pay per each transaction based on the exact Service Level from the Provider.This model also allows for 3rda parties to participate in the Contract as Arbitrators.

Start response time SLA counter once record is created (saved)
Automatically change state to “Assigned” when assignment group is selected
If you need to wait for acknowledgment from assignment group before the Resolution time SLA starts counting, create new state to represent Work in Progress, that the assigned team transitions to after acknowledgment and when they start working on the ticket, that’s where the resolution time SLA starts counting.
If the assignment group will start working on the ticket immediately without waiting for a user to be assigned, Start resolution time SLA counter once Assignment group is selected and the record is updated (notification sent to group)
If the assignment group manager must assign the ticket to a user before work starts, response time keeps counting until the assigned to field is populated and ticket is updated, then start resolution time SLA counter once Assigned to is selected and the record is updated (notification sent to user)
Using this model, you can start monitoring reassignments count to groups and users, which is good KPI to measure how the ticket bounces between different groups and how this affects total SLA (Amgad Abdelhafez - Nov 10, 2016)"," (Amgad Abdelhafez - Nov 10, 2016)","final inc states (Amgad Abdelhafez - Nov 10, 2016)"
