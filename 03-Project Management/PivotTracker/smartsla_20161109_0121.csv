13 Oct 20:11

Problem: 
Enforcing IT Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and their consumers is challenging using current industry practices and technology. IT Financial Management is currently focused, or rather limited to retroactive cost analysis, shadow charging and accounting for Providers' periodical billing.

Solution Abstract: 
Use Smart Contracts to implement Service Level Agreements between MSPs and their consumers. Each Service Request from the Consumer to the MSP is recorded by the Contract, governed by the terms and conditions of the Service Agreement, in addition to the specific SLA targets based on the Request. 

The Contract can be used to govern and settle transactions between the two parties based on real time State updates of the request, where the Consumer can only pay the provider for Service Requests fulfilled within the SLA targets, or pay per each transaction based on the exact Service Level from the Provider.This model also allows for 3rda parties to participate in the Contract as Arbitrators.
