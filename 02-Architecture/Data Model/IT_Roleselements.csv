"
"aaa7064f","BusinessProcess","Accounting","this process enables an IT organization to account for the way its money is spent. This particularly refers to identification of costs by customer, by service or by activity. For example, accounting will answer the question “How much does e-mail service (per mailbox) cost?” Someone who pays the bill (internal or external customer) wants to know the answer. To answer such a question, IT financial management has to know of which cost-item e-mail service is build (e.g. hardware, software, people, etc.).

Accounting is a process that can be highly complex. There are some costs that are easily identifiable, but there are some costs that are usually approximated. Let’s take Service Desk resources as an example (people, technology, fixed costs). It is (usually) good enough for people working at the Service Desk to estimate time they spend on a certain service, rather than counting every minute of their activity. What I found out is that people who are paying the bills (valid for both internal as well as external customers) wants to know the structure of the costs that they are paying for. Therefore, it is crucial to have the most detailed cost structure possible for services that are billed.



An efficient accounting process increases IT service provision and defines areas where cost savings can be made (i.e. financial efficiency). There are several cost elements that accounting uses:

Capital Costs (or capital expenditure – CAPEX) – cost of purchasing something that will become a financial asset, e.g. server.
Operational Costs (or operational expenditure – OPEX) – cost incurred from running the services, e.g. electricity invoices, salary… Depending on organization’s (financial) strategy, CAPEX and OPEX can be governed. Cloud services are an example. Organization can shift capital expenditure (investing in own data centre infrastructure) to operational expenditure (monthly fee for resources required) by using cloud services instead of its own.
Direct Costs – costs that can be directly applied to a certain service or customer, e.g. purchase of a server that will be used for one particular service.
Indirect Costs – costs that cannot be directly allocated to a particular service or customer, e.g. SW licence for server which runs several applications or serves several customers.
Fixed Costs – costs that don’t change with IT service usage or in the short-term, e.g. annual lease contract.
Variable Costs – costs that vary in the short-term depending how much service is used, e.g. energy consumed to run servers."

Planning is important because it decreases risk of over-spending in the future. The same process controls income and costs incurred on a monthly basis. This means that monthly income and monthly costs will be monitored and compared with budgeted (i.e. planned) funds. Based on that information, measures can be taken to implement corrections that will keep the budget on track.

Budgeting, as a cross-department process, usually belongs to the financial department or CFO. IT contributes for services, resources and costs. It occurs once a year and usually includes the running business year, the next year and even more. I know that it is hard to know what will happen in the next, say, two years; but, even so, budgeting for the next few years defines the strategic development of an organization."

"8ae95a75","BusinessProcess","Charging","Charging provides the ability to assign costs of an IT Service proportionally and fairly to the users of that service. It may be used as a first step towards an IT organization operating as an autonomous business. It may also be used to encourage users to move in a strategically important direction - for example by subsidizing newer systems and imposing additional charges for the use of legacy systems. Transparency of charging will encourage users to avoid expensive activities where slightly more inconvenient but far cheaper alternatives are available. For example, a user might browse a dump on screen rather than printing it off.

Charging is arguably the most complex of the three sub-processes, requiring a large investment of resources and a high degree of care to avoid anomalies, where an individual department may benefit from behavior which is detrimental to the company as a whole. Charging policy needs to be simultaneously simple, fair and realistic.

Charging need not necessarily mean money changing hands (full charging). It may take the form of information passed to management on the cost of provision of IT services (no charging), or may detail what would be charged if full charging were in place without transactions actually being applied to the financial ledgers (notional charging). Notional charging may also be used as a way of piloting full charging.

"7ef131c5","BusinessProcess","Charging","is the activity whereby payment is required for services delivered. Charging requires that accounting procedures and systems exist and are set up. It makes a difference whether the organization is an internal service provider, or if it serves external customer as its main business. In the case where an IT organization is an internal service provider (according to ITIL, these are Type I and Type II organizations), it is not necessary to bill for services. Sometimes such IT organizations only allocate costs. If an IT organization sells its services to external customers (Type III organization) they will, certainly, issue bills for their services and generate income which funds that organization.

Charging for services by an organization with external customers is the only way to get funding for the organization, cover costs and generate revenue. But, in the case of an internal service provider it can be seen as bureaucratic procedure, which is true. On the other side, I found that internal charging has several advantages:

It justifies IT resources needed (increased transparency),
users throughout organization use only resources they really need (optimization of usage),
business can plan their cost of operation (which is, further on, included in price charged to their customers), and
IT has better control of its business."

2.4.1 Process Overview
The Financial Management process provides the business and IT with the quantification (in financial terms) of the value of IT services, the value of the assets underlying the provisioning of those services, and the qualification of operational forecasting. It includes all function and processes responsible for managing an IT service provider's budgeting, accounting and charging policies and activities.
Key objectives of Financial Management are:
• Establishing and enforcing IT financial controls
• Ensuring compliance with legal, industry, and corporate standards and procedures
Assisting IT portfolio investment decisions by providing detailed business cases as well as financial input for decision support
• Effectively predicting and controlling IT budgets
• Providing the enterprise with operational visibility, insight, and superior decision-making.
The overriding goal of Financial Management is to provide cost effective stewardship of the IT assets and the financial resources used in providing IT services. Primarily this is to enable an organization to account fully for the financial resources consumed by the IT service provider and to attribute these costs to the services delivered to the organization’s customers.
This is accomplished by the categorization, collection and analysis of accounting, contract and pricing data including the following typical cost elements:
• Hardware and software license costs
• Annual maintenance fees for hardware and software
• Personnel resources used in the support or maintenance of a service
• Utilities, data centre or other facilities charges
• Taxes, capital or interest charges
• Compliance costs
• Transfer costs and internal charging by other business units/processes.

Purpose
•  Provide chargeback or showback for internal and external services taking into account service Subscription and Usage information.
•  Break down chargeback or showback based on charge types such as CapEx/OpEx, direct/indirect, fixed/variable, and labor/non-labor, as well as by consumer or consumer groups.
•  Charge for IT services rendered based on the pricing model associated with the catalog item, this may also be implemented via showback (no actual billing or cross-charging), which helps the consumer become more IT cost-aware.
•  Trace chargeback or showback line items to individual cost drivers based on the cost model.
•  Consolidate IT service Subscription (right to use) and actual Usage as the usage may differ from the right to use.

The Chargeback/Showback functional component:
•  Shall provide the price of consuming/subscribing to a service.
•  Can take actual usage into consideration when calculating the price of consuming a service.
If an IT Financial Management component exists, the Chargeback/Showback functional component:
•  Can provide the necessary information in order for the IT Financial Management supporting function to produce invoices or bills for services rendered."
